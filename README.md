Welcome to the Project DNA homepage!
------------------------------------
Project DNA was a project I have worked on in one of my college classes that messes with inputted DNA strands and does things like identify mutations, convert DNA to RNA, etc.

Usage
-----
The project DNA program is mean't to help you, the user, with your scientific pursuits in understanding how certain DNA strands work. When you open the program, you will be prompted
with a list of options. You will input a number based on your preferred choice, and input your DNA stand(s) that you want to work with, as shown in this example:
